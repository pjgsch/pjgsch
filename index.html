My name is Piet Schreurs.
I live in the Netherlands, where I was born - in 1955 -, 
raised and educated.
  
<p>
At Eindhoven University of Technology I finished my study
Mechanical Engineering in 1979 and my PhD research in 1983.
From 1984 to 2021 I worked at the same university in the 
Department of Mechanical Engineering, ending up as an 
Associate Professor.

On 
<a href="https://pjgsch.github.io" target="_blank">Github</a>
I collected some information and tools, which I made during my
professional life and which I still use today.
  
<p>
Now, after being retired, I spend a reasonable bit of time as
a volunteer in the local library, mainly learning people how
to use their computer, smartphone, info-sites on the web, etc.
Learning non-dutch speakers to communicate in the Dutch language
is also part of my voluntary work.
<br>

<p>
The last 50 years I spent a lot of time running, in my village/town,
in my country and in Western-Europe.
This running is now reduced to jogging, but here is a
<a href="https://pjgsch.home.xs4all.nl/htm/runs2.html" target="_blank">list</a>
of running distances and times from the past.
